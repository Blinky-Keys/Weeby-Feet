I am a developer with a keen interest in hacking and cybersecurity. I maintain my own website (as well as the infrastructure it relies on), which I built from the ground up. I also write my own blog where I document all of the new things that I have learned, as well as my successes (and failures) from participating in Capture The Flag challenges. 

### Capture The Flag ⛳

I regularly participate in CTF challenges on both the Hack The Box and Try Hack Me platforms, having finished the first Hack The Box season with a silver ranking.
